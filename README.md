# Automation-of-psychosocial-assessment
 
Project Overview

This project aims to digitalize the Colombian Ministry of Labor’s psychosocial risk assessment battery (Batería de Instrumentos para la Evaluación de Factores de Riesgo Psicosocial). The goal is to transform the traditional paper-based questionnaire into an online survey (using SurveyJS) and automate data processing, scoring, and reporting with modern tools.

Current Status

✅ SurveyJS implementation: Online questionnaire created with proper structure and scoring scale.

✅ Excel templates: Baremos and scoring formulas prepared using Excel + Power Query for data cleaning and transformation.

⏳ Work in progress: Integration of visualization and reporting with Power BI.


Next Steps
Add Power BI dashboards for data visualization.
Automate reporting (individual and group levels).
Explore deployment options for companies (GitHub Pages / internal hosting).
